<h1>Your new Package</h1>

<p>
Your new package is there! You can edit the package properties in the package manager. 
Use the edit button in the upper right corner of the package details panel to
open the package editor.
</p>

<p>
Here is what you should do:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enter your author details</li>
  <li>Choose a license model</li>
  <li>Provide an icon and optionally a screenshot image</li>
  <li>Complete the technology definition</li>
  <li>Specify dependencies if you plan to use items from other packages</li>
</ul>

<p>
Of course, the most interesting thing is how to edit the technology definition.
When the package was initialized, a folder hierarchy consisting of a tech
folder containing a technology definition file and empty "libraries", "macros", 
"pymacros" and "drc" folders was created. You can use these empty folders
to put your own files there. The technology definition can be edited in the
technology manager where you can find the technology as "new_tech" under the
name you had given the package. Initially, the technology definition is 
without any particular definitions.
</p>

<p>
In the package details you will find the local path to your package
data under "Installation". You can use any versioning system to manage your
files there. 
</p>

<p>
Once you have finished your package, don't forget to specify the package version
so users of you package will be informed of updates. Finally you can publish the
package files to a place of your choice and submit the download URL to the 
Salt Mine server.
